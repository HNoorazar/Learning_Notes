\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:Fundamentals_Introduction}
I start my notes with the fundamentals definitions such
as that of covariance. I prefer not to assume any
background for readers and also to present these at
the beginning of the book, rather than at the end as an appendix,
at the cost of postponing the core ideas of statistical learning.
