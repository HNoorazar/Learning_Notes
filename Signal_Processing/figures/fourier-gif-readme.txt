English: Function s(x) (in red) is an approximation of a square wave formed from just 6 sine functions of different amplitudes and harmonically-related frequencies. Their summation is called a Fourier series. The Fourier transform, S(f) (in blue), which depicts amplitude vs frequency, reveals the 6 frequencies and their amplitudes.
