\chapter{Compressive Sampling}
\label{sec:CompressiveSampling}
Compressive sampling, a.k.a compressed sensing,
is a method to reconstruct certain signals/images from
fewer samples/measurements than traditional methods~\citep{candes2008intro}.''

\textbf{Bandlimiting} is the limiting of a signal's frequency domain 
representation or spectral density to zero above a certain finite frequency.

A band-limited signal is one whose Fourier transform or spectral 
density has bounded support.\marginnote{This definition came from Wikipedia.}

Said differently, a signal is said to be band-limited if the amplitude 
of its spectrum goes to zero for all frequencies beyond some threshold 
called the cutoff frequency.

CS relies on two principles
$
\begin{cases} 
  \text{sparsity: related/pertains to the signal of interest}\\
   \text{incoherence: related/pertains to signal modality}. \\
\end{cases}
