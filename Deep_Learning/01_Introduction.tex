How do we extract usable information from data, especially data that is full of noise and or information that has nothing to do with the information we are interested in extracting?

That this is an old challenge is underlined by the fact that the first
appearance of the phrase ``Looking for a needle in a haystack'' is
nearly 500 years old.\marginnote{First known appearance of the idiom
  ``Looking for a needle in a haystack'', in written English, is from
  St.\@ Thomas More, in 1532. The actual quote is ``to go looking for a
  needle in a meadow''.}  But the fact that life introduces
confounding data -- entropy, noise, etc -- has made this idiom a part
of the working wisdom of anyone trying to make careful inferences,
implying the idea is much, much older.
