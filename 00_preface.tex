It was the third semester of undergraduate 
when I took my first course in analysis. Even though
I hated the passionless not knowledgable instructor
who copied words from the book to the board, I loved
the topic. This was probably the only time that I hated
the instructor and find a fire about the topic. Never
sought it though. I also liked probability. Finally, after
just floating around, it is time to master them. Even though
I liked probability and am learning it, part of me is missing
if I do not do analysis. If I hear math, I think of analysis. How
can I not seek it?

I hope I can start this document by taking notes via copying the 
exact words of the references mentioned here and
then treat each concept like a playdough. 
Play with them, stretch them, etc. Immerse them in them
so that they become part of me.

I will mix exercises from analysis, probability, measure theory,
linear algebra, etc. as I find it easy to solve problems listed at the end of
chapters of the books I read as I am following the flow but hard
otherwise. Hopefully, this will make me and the potential readers
more versatile and practical.
