\section{Pursuit Methods}
\label{sec:Pursuit_Methods}
In this section we consider greedy methods
for representing a signal; basis pursuit, matching pursuit,
and orthogonal matching pursuit.

\subsection{Basis Pursuit}

\marginnote{Basis pursuit and Focal Underdetermined System Solvers
can be motivated by Maximum a Posteriori~\citep{AharonKSVD}.
The MAP can be used to estimate the 
coefficients as random variables by maximizing 
the posterior $P(\mathbf{x|y, D}) \propto P(\mathbf{y|x, D}) P(\mathbf{x})$. 
The prior distribution on the coefficient 
vector $\mathbf{x}$ is assumed to be a super-Gaussian (i.i.d.) 
distribution that favors sparsity. For the Laplace 
distribution, this approach is equivalent to BP [22].}
