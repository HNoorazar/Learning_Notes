\section{Tech Papers}
\label{sec:Tech_Papers}
The first paper from Tech I am reading this is~\cite{graepel2010web}.
At least the first one I am taking notes on in this Notes. 
Interesting and new things in it.

\item [Advertisement Players Objectives] are three in this paper.
advertisers, users, and the
search engine. These three types of players have different,
even contradictory objectives. Advertisers are interested
in maximising their return on investment at high volume.
Users would like to see maximally relevant ads that help
them pursue their intent. The search engine would like to
maximize revenue and growth.

Internally, these conflicting goals are mapped to different
key performance indicators (KPIs) that are used to tune
the ad selection system. However, these KPIs are
influenced by a large number of other subsystems such as
fraud detection, query expansion, keyword-query
matching, etc. Furthermore, there are a large number of
parameters influencing the KPIs including reserve prices
and rank-score parameters. So, while the ultimate test of a
CTR predictor lies in its performance as part of the ad
selection system, in a modular architecture it is often best
to identify isolated performance measures as proxies for
in-system performance.

\item [Distribution changes over time] due to seasonality, 
change of taste, changes in web content, economic conditions, etc. 
Online algorithms, batch learning on shifting windows.


\item [Exploration vs. Exploitation] Interesting point: The ads shown
to users is decided by the algorithm that predicts which ads are good.
But then, those will be our training set for future. So, the trade-off between
exploration and exploitation should be considered.
