\section*{Motivation/Background}

I am starting to learn and immerse myself in
machine learning and image processing field.
I decided to take notes and collect everything new and
useful I learn. Perhaps, I can combine them in one
single file and put it on arXiv eventually.

The reason is that there are things that I like very much
but have not had a chance to learn and work on them. 
Hence, I will collect whatever I learn in these notes. 
Moreover, I like to collect topics that important for job
interviewers.

There will be at least 4 parts to this series; regression,
classification, clustering, deep learning, and last but 
not the least, signal/image processing.

Personally, I do not want to do deep learning until
I have a chance to work in a team with experts in the field. 
The reason is it seems there is no logic to the structure of 
networks. I prefer to learn by getting my hands dirty. However, 
I do like the convolutional neural networks with application in 
images and videos and will play with them if I have time.


\section*{Structure of My Notes}
I will try to write the notes so that it is approachable
to everyone; with or without mathematics backgrounds.
The not-too-technical parts will be written in boxes.
