The Papers for a vigorous, year long course are here, in this directory and the harmonic analysis on graphs directory. 

The Textbook selections are made in the "Notes-for-CGAD-GTOpt-meeting-Mar-8-2021-including-book-suggestions.pdf" and I give both the essentials and the very important more advanced texts.

The Books directory contains quite a few of the book, the ones that are given away for free, or at least I have permission to give away to those that are interested in the content.
