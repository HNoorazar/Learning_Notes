# Learning Notes

I will collect everything I learn in LaTex files here.

These notes are for me. 
Said differently, I do not intend to repeat others' work/words.
Said differently, there are too many books/sources out there with the same content AND the same language;
finding a good/different source is difficult. 
In other words, there are books that have
nothing new to say, yet, they are out there.
I think ideally, the book/paper must have something new to say,
or say something old in a new way that can reach the reader from
a different angle; some people speak the same language, and some do not.

In summary, if you are reading this, I do not intend to add to the noise,
and hopefully, you can find these notes be useful.
