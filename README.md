# Learning Notes

I will collect everything I learn in LaTex files here.

These notes are for me. 
Said differently, I do not intend to repeat others' work/words.
Said differently, there are too many books/sources out there with the same content AND the same language;
finding a good/different source is difficult. 
In other words, there are books that have
nothing new to say, yet, they are out there.
I think ideally, the book/paper must have something new to say,
or say something old in a new way that can reach the reader from
a different angle; some people speak the same language, and some do not.

In summary, if you are reading this, I do not intend to add to the noise,
and hopefully, you can find these notes be useful.

You may have asked yourself, while reading Stat. books,
why all the text and examples are so clean. The answer might have
occured to you as well as it is mentioned in Applied Numerical Analysis (Curtis Gerald);
"Interpret the numerical result to arrive at a decision. 
This will require experience and an understanding of 
the situation in which the problem is embedded. 
This interpretation is the hardest part of solving problems and must be learned on the job...
cannot be meaningfully treated in the classroom."


So, maybe tech companies with their trillion dollars can 
provide more internships (cut pay rate of current internships if needed and increase number of interns),
 or perhaps some people are willing
to work for free for them to get real-world experience.
I will stop right there, otherwise, god forbid, someone's ego may be
hurt! 

There also must be free data available or even buy to expetiment with.
