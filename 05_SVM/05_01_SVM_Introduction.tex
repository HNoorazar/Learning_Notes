\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:SVM_Introduction}

I start my notes with the Chapter 12 of Tibshirani's 
book\cite{Hastie2001elements} and then move to the 
Steinwart's book\cite{steinwart2008support}; Support Vector Machines.

Optimal separating hyperplanes are for the case when two classes are 
linearly separable; it provides a linear decision boundaries for classification. 
Here we cover extensions to the nonseparable case, 
where the classes overlap. These techniques are then generalized to 
what is known as the support vector machine, which produces 
nonlinear boundaries by constructing a linear boundary in a large, 
transformed version of the feature space.
